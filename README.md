# 🧐 Age & Gender Detection App 🚀  
A Smart Streamlit App for Predicting Age and Gender from Faces in Real-Time

Welcome to the **Age & Gender Detection App**! This project uses **deep learning** and **computer vision** to detect faces in images, video, or webcam feeds and predict their **age range** and **gender** using pre-trained neural networks — all packed into a sleek and interactive **Streamlit** web interface.

## 🛆 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gender-and-Age-Detection.git
cd Gender-and-Age-Detection

# Recommended to use a virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, manually install:

```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python-headless numpy
```

> Use `opencv-python` instead of `opencv-python-headless` if you're not running in a headless environment.

## ▶️ How to Run the App

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Once launched, your default browser will open with the app running at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Face Detection**  
   Uses a pre-trained OpenCV DNN face detector (`.pb` and `.pbtxt`) to locate faces in the input.

2. **Age & Gender Prediction**  
   Cropped face regions are passed through:
   - `age_net.caffemodel` → Predicts age group like `(8-12)`, `(20-28)`, etc.
   - `gender_net.caffemodel` → Predicts either `Male` or `Female`.

3. **Overlay Results**  
   Predictions are drawn with dynamic text size based on face box height for visibility and aesthetic placement.
